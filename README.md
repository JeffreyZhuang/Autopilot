# Autopilot

The goal is to write simple code for an RC plane autopilot that is easy to understand, easy to trace, and follows best practices for safety-critical embedded firmware.
- For small hand-launched and belly landing fixed-wing UAVs
- Automatic takeoff, waypoint following, and landing
- The GCS is mandatory for operation like most military UAVs
